There are many different immersion strategies you can use to improve your learning. Over time, you’ll find the ones that work best for you.

For now, though, keep it simple:

1.  Find a video on YouTube with TL subtitles. (ideally 10 minutes)
2.  Watch it once without subtitles.
3.  Watch it again using Language Reactor. Look up words as you go and try to understand what’s happening.
4.  Watch it again with audio and TL subtitles without pausing.

For anime:

1.  Watch with English subtitles
2.  Watch without any subtitles
3.  Are you done for today? (Yes=Put the episodes on in the background to listen while you do other things. | No= Go back to step 1.)

Essentially, by watching the episode with subtitles first, you have increased the comprehensibility of your input.

By listening to it when doing other things, you are filling in the silence with Japanese, which means, even if for a few seconds, you may pay attention to what's being said.

Note: Listening while doing other things = **passive immersion**. Listening with undivided attention = **active immersion**
