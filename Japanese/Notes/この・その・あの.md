Another way of saying "this" and "that", similar to [[これ・それ・あれ・どれ]]

| Term | Definition                                        |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| この   | this                                              |
| その   | that (object far from speaker, close to listener) |
| あの   | that (object far from speaker and listener)       |
| どの   | which                                             |

Unlike これ・それ・あれ, these connect directly with the noun.

Like this:

> このほんはぼくのです
> This book is mine.

That is; the は isn't after この.
