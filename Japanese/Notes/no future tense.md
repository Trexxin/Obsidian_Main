The English language has three basic verb tenses, past, present and future. There are other tenses in English, such as the passive and past progressive tense, but generally we tend to think in terms of “I went,” “I go,” and “I will go.” **Japanese does not have separate present and future tenses**.

Whether you are talking about the present or future will usually be picked up through context.
