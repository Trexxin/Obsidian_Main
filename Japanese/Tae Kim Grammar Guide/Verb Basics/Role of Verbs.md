Verbs, in Japanese, always come at the end of clauses. Since we have not yet learned how to create more than one clause, for now it means that any sentence with a verb must end with the verb. Before learning about verbs, there is one important thing to keep in mind.

- **A grammatically complete sentence requires a verb only (including state-of-being).**

Or to rephrase, unlike English, the only thing you need to make a grammatically complete sentence is a verb and nothing else! That’s why even the simplest, most basic Japanese sentence cannot be translated into English!

A grammatically complete sentence:

- 食べる。  
	Eat. (possible translations include: I eat/she eats/they eat)
