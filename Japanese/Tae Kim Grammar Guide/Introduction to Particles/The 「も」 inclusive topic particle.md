Another particle that is very similar to the topic particle is the inclusive topic particle. It is essentially the topic particle with the additional meaning of "also". Basically, it can introduce another topic in addition to the current topic. The inclusive topic particle is the 「も」 character and its use is best explained by an example.

#### Example 1
- ボブ: アリスは学生？
>Bob: Is Alice (you) student?

- アリス: うん、トムも学生。
>Alice: Yeah, and Tom is also student.

The inclusion of 「も」 must be consistent with the answer. It would not make sense to say, "I am a student, and Tom is also not a student." Instead, use the 「は」 particle to make a break from the inclusion as seen in the next example.

#### Example 2
- ボブ: アリスは学生？
>Bob: Is Alice (you) student?

- アリス: うん、でもトムは学生じゃない。
>Alice: Yeah, but Tom is not student.

Below is an example of inclusion with the negative.

#### Example 3
- ボブ: アリスは学生？
>Bob: Is Alice (you) student?

- アリス: ううん、トムも学生じゃない。
>Alice: No, and Tom is also not student.
