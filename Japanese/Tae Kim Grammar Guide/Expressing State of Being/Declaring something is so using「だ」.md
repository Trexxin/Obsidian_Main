One of the trickiest part of Japanese is that there is no verb for the state-of-being like the verb "to be" in English. You can, however, declare what something is by attaching the Hiragana character 「だ」 to a noun or な-adjective **only**. 

#### Declaring that something is so using 「だ」
- Attach 「だ」 to the noun or な-adjective
- Example:人＋だ＝人だ

#### Examples
- 人だ。
>Is person.

- 学生だ。
>Is student.

- 元気だ。
>Is well.

**A state-of-being can also be implied without using 「だ」!**
