The な-adjective is very simple to learn because it acts essentially like a noun. All the conjugation rules for both nouns and な-adjectives are the same. One main difference is that a な-adjective can directly modify a noun following it by sticking 「な」 between the adjective and noun. (Hence the name, な-adjective.)

#### Examples
- 静かな人。
>Quiet person.

- きれいな人。
>Pretty person.

You can also use adjectives with particles

#### Examples
- 友達は親切。
>Friend is kind.

- 友達は親切な人だ。
>Friend is kind person.

As shown by the following examples, the conjugation rules for な-adjectives are the same as nouns.

#### Examples
- ボブは魚が好きだ。
>Bob likes fish.

- ボブは魚が好きじゃない。
>Bob does not like fish.

- ボブは魚が好きだった。
>Bob liked fish.

- ボブは魚が好きじゃなかった。
>Bob did not like fish.

If it bothers you that "like" is an adjective and not a verb in Japanese, you can think of 「好き」 as meaning "desirable". Also, you can see a good example of the topic and identifier particle working in harmony. The sentence is about the topic "Bob" and "fish" identifies specifically what Bob likes.

You can also use the last three conjugations to directly modify the noun. (Remember to attach 「な」 for positive non-past tense.)

#### Examples
- 魚が好きな人。
>Person that likes fish.

- 魚が好きじゃない人。
>Person that does not like fish.

- 魚が好きだった人。
>Person that liked fish.

- 魚が好きじゃなかった人。
>Person that did not like fish.

Here, the entire clause 「魚が好き」、「魚が好きじゃない」、etc. is modifying "person" to talk about people that like or dislike fish. You can see why this type of sentence is useful because 「人は魚が好きだ」 would mean "People like fish", which isn't always the case.

We can even treat the whole descriptive noun clause as we would a single noun. For instance, we can make the whole clause a topic like the following example.

#### Examples
- 魚が好きじゃない人は、肉が好きだ。
>Person who does not like fish like meat.

- 魚が好きな人は、野菜も好きだ。
>Person who likes fish also likes vegetables.
